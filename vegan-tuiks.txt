Once you realize person and take the path of veganism, 
99% of desertchetata in shiny packages in windows 
drop out of the list of foods matter if they are harmful :) 
Everyone likes to be rewarded for small victories 
with something favorite, sweet and especially diet. 
Desertchetata such as Snickers, Mars & Twix are quite successful flavor 
combination of chocolate, caramel, cookie and possibly nuts. 
And I'm definitely not the only one trying to make a vegan version - in the net there are many recipes,
most of them quite successful. I stole her away from there and here's what happened:

Cookie:

1 1/2 cup ground oats (maybe oatmeal)
1/2 cup ground almonds (my were blanched)
2 tablespoons rice flour or coconut
3 tablespoons Maple syrup
1/4 cup melted coconut oil
pinch of salt
Generally stuck to gluten-free flour, but you can try with wheat or einkorn and share the results.

All ingredients have mixed in a bowl omesih shortbread, which is almost crumbs and I shaped into a ball. 
In tray covered with baking paper, with pressure 
I shaped the dough square / rectangle with a thickness of no more than 1 cm. 
If you want cookies to be thinner, do the base about half a centimeter. 
With a sharp knife I cut the base of the long thin rectangles. 
Actually you can cut them into squares, triangles, or any other shape you like. 
Only meant to be comfortable enough then dip the cookies into a bowl of melted chocolate.
